# Restaurant-Analysis

This project presents a two-level analysis of a restaurant dataset, beginning with comprehensive data cleaning.

In Level 1 : Focuses on foundational insights - Identifying the most popular cuisines, analyzing restaurant distribution across cities, and exploring price range patterns.

In Level 2 : Dives deeper into advanced analytics, including restaurant rating trends, frequent cuisine pairings, and geographic distribution using location data.
Each task is supported by clear visualizations and modular code for reproducibility.
The analysis offers actionable insights for understanding dining trends, customer preferences and market dynamic.
